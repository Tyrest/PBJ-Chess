# PBJ-Chess

A chess AI that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to determine the optimal move.

Uses python-chess for chess logic and UI.

Will eventually read from the polyglot opening book to make sure the bot makes reasonable moves in the beginning of a game. Additionally, PBJ Chess will eventually make use of python-chess's Gaviota and Syzygy ending tables to ensure victory in the endgame.
